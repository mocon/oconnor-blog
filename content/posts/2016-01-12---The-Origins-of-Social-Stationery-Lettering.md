When you think of a person as ‘confident,’ they are usually pretty cool, unflappable, even insouciant, but they carry themselves with an authority that those around them find compelling.  

Picture Martin Luther King Jr.  as he led a walk with five thousand demonstrators; or fourteen year old Greta Thurnberg,  addressing a United Nations assembly, many of whom older than her grandparents, saying “How dare you!”  Ms. Thurnberg and Dr. King leave us in no doubt about what it is that matters to them. What had been instilled within each of them became the defining nature of their engagement with the world.  There is a liberation, an experience of freedom found in the clarity that comes from living ‘out’ what resides ‘within’ — ‘“this is who I am and what I care about.” 

What are you to draw from so as to leave no doubt who you are and what you care about? 

The US Marine Corps has a good idea what.  Their creed, Semper Fidelis, defines living in confidence.  Semper Fidelis, Always Faithful, has described the ethos of the Marine Corps for generations.  Fidelis, fidelity, describes an act of  trusting in something so fully that we have decided it is worthy to give our hearts to.   So the question  becomes, what is it we declare our semper fidelis to?  What have we decided is an object or a project worthy enough to give our heart to?  The answer is right there in front of you.  It is you, in all your goodness, in all your faults, in the all that makes up the all of you.

Two remarkable people come to mind who embodied their version of semper fidelis.  When Katherine Johnson wrote the research paper providing the mathematical calculations for NASA that made possible the coordination of the Apollo lunar module with the orbiting Command module, she was embodying a fidelity to her truest self.  Her brilliant career with the space program was founded on her love for math.  The first African American woman to enroll in West Virginia’s graduate schools,  she spent her entire career opening doors previously barred to a person of color, not to mention the barriers she overcame as a woman in the overwhelmingly male environment of early NASA.   After 33 years with the space program, she retired, saying, “I loved going to work every single day.”  She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, at age 97.  

How fitting that Ms. Johnson’s medal would be labelled ‘Freedom.”  She lived and worked in fidelity to a gift revealing what resided in her heart, leading her to a life she could unequivocally say,  she loved.  That each of us would be so fortunate. 	
	
Paul Kitagaki Jr., a photojournalist with the Sacramento Bee, has created a photographic record of the people, including his parents and family, affected by Executive Order #9066, FDR’s decree in 1942 to round up and incarcerate US citizens of Japanese descent.  Kitagaki describes the 30 plus year project as, “. . . a labor of love,”  matching current photos of survivors with the historic photos of them taken in 1942.  The exhibition, entitled “Gambatte! Legacy of an Enduring Spirit,” has exposed the horror of the forced internment and its enduring effect on the people’s lives.  More importantly though, Mr. Kitagaki has revealed what resides in his heart, where the humanity of the internees forces us to lament the evils of their incarceration and at the same time be humbled by their courage and integrity.
	
These two, Katherine Johnson and Paul Kitagawi Jr., discovered a unique desire within themselves that could not but be brought forth .  The fidelity to their own ‘enduring spirit’ is their legacy.   Few of us received the wisdom of Polonius when we set out in life, but we are heartened when living in fidelity to our ‘enduring spirit,’ knowing truly that our unique gift is what the world desperately needs.    

What is it, residing within you, that cannot but be brought out into the light?
