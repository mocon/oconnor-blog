description: Sooner or later we come into contact with ‘forces greater than
  ourselves,’ which if we’re not ready for them can sweep us up before we know
  what’s happened. The created world holds a litany of awesome forces –– oceans,
  deserts, mountains; behemoths, leviathans; the cosmos; all majestically dwarf
  us. Consider love, loving an other, or for that matter truly giving ourselves
  in love to anything, is a willing entrance into uncharted territory defined as
  much by what we don’t know and our deep vulnerability as anything else. Then
  there’s God, unknowable yet present in every moment of our lives, how are we
  to step up in encounters with her? Daunting to be sure, but this is the
  situation we find ourselves in. So is there a stance we can adopt that might
  keep us from being overwhelmed and at the same time set us up to be receptive
  to the encounter with these great forces?
