Not Knowing Is Most Intimate

Practitioners of Zen Buddhism wrestle with a teaching story of a master questioning a pilgrim:

Dizang, the teacher, asks the pilgrim Fayan, "Where are you going?"

Fayan says, "Around on pilgrimage."

Dizang then asks, "What is the purpose of pilgrimage?"

Fayan replies, "I don't know."

Dizang responds, "Not knowing is most intimate.”

In this short exchange, a practice in Zen called a koan, the teaching is designed not to help the student somehow figure out the correct answer, but to guide the student to allow the question to figure out the student. To understand a way to approach this koan, writer / poet / Zen priest Norman Fischer writes that, as best as we can manage,  all experience should be met with ‘empty hands,’ so that ‘every moment of encounter’ holds the possibility of our being reached. Fischer warns of the risk ‘knowing’ entails,   *“ . . . without not knowing, the world would never be.”*

“The world would never be’ sounds dire, maybe a little melodramatic, but consider how limited your experience of the world would be if it was made up solely of what you already knew. There’d be no room for surprise, wonder and mystery would be missed, leaving an aridity too awful to contemplate. Leo Tolstoy, in War and Peace, writes that the highest degree of human wisdom occurs when we accept that *“We can know only that we know nothing”*  

Now this isn’t an indictment of knowledge but an assertion that something more is asked of us in every moment of our lives, if we truly want to embrace the astonishing and singular being each of us is. So much wisdom, from Jesus to Dr. King, from Aquinas to Hafiz, from Nietzsche to Emily Dickinson, pleading with us to recognize how fleeting and precious this life of ours is; that it’s our one and only shot at being our singular self, and to waste even a moment of it is to squander a great gift. When we hold on to things we ‘know’ at the expense of what’s unfolding in the moment, it’s as  tragic as being left in the starting blocks when we could have run the race of our lives.

Thomas Merton, Trappist monk, writer, and poet, describes what’s required of us to meet the demands this sense of immediacy makes on us:

> *“You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope.”* 

Willingly setting aside the things we know for the *‘possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment’* appears to put us at a disadvantage. After all, we know an awful lot, and use our knowledge for good things, working, planning, and arriving at deep insights being just a few. But these are about us, and as noble a thing as each of us is, life is bigger and has much more in store for us –– if we’re open to it.  This, I believe, is why Merton felt we needed courage, faith and hope when putting ourselves out on such a limb. Without our hard won knowledge, the record of our accomplishments and the accumulated wisdom of our years, absent all that, what have we to fall back on to when the ‘possibilities and challenges’ present themselves.            

The short answer is not much, and that’s just how life would have us engage with her. If I can find the courage to meet with the present as the pilgrim Fayan, answering “I don’t know,” to what may be unfolding, I have nothing to fall back on to. I’m engaging with life unarmed, unadorned, unmasked and uncomfortable –– in other words, open and vulnerable. And having set aside for the moment what I know, I’ve made myself available to what’s about to be revealed.  

In such a moment, what’s about to reveal itself becomes teacher, and I student, or to put it another way, the present moment is the subject in this exchange and I become its object. In the ordinariness of our lives this is what holy looks like. The moment could be an experience, say of some natural wonder that bowls me over by its beauty and power.  The moment could be an individual, someone whose presence and singular story inspires me to cherish the mystery and wonder held there. In each case, having been met by something previously unknown, I’m made different, humbled by the abundance of the world, and moved to compassion by the privilege of the encounter.     

As life so often does, the present moment requires us to make a decision. Can we risk setting aside what we know and instead place our trust in who we are, coming to see it’s in this willingness to engage with life undefended that transforms *not knowing* into *intimacy.* Intimacy happens in the exchange between parties of what’s innermost within them, it’s the basis for our most loving and connected relationships. Think of the moment you first experienced love, first felt ocean waves wash over you, or were met by something so wonder-filled you were left without words.  

This is what happens when we choose to meet life without knowing, the present moment takes over, establishing relationship with us as we are. Both parties are made different in the event, that one moment will be marked forever because we remember how we felt and became through what it revealed –– about us both. Remember though, it started with us showing up, not knowing, but ready for whatever was on the way. Intimacy with and acceptance of ourselves makes us courageous, not because anything’s been added, but because much has been shed. No longer in need of our armor, no longer needing to rely on anything more complicated than what already resides in our hearts, we’re free to be surprised
