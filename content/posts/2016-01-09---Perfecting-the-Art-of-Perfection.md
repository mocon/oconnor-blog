description: >
  To be ‘returned to ourself’ is simply to be brought back into the truth of who
  each of us is. All the philosophies, theologies, or ideologies, for all their
  value, cannot compare with the richness and life that already exists within
  us. Notice the ‘returning’ is done to us, not by us.  This is important, for
  it is through our relationship with others and with God that we are brought
  back. Brought back, kind of to where we started, but to a self that emerges as
  infinitely ‘more’ by way of the exchange with that ‘other.’

Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, murdered by a government assassin while celebrating Mass in San Salvador in 1980, had three years earlier been returned, back to his true self.  He paid for the journey with his life.  It had been a bruising path back to himself, full of trepidation and misguided attempts to find his way as a leader of his church.  The atmosphere in El Salvador then, as it remains today, was tense with violence, with rampant corruption, overlaid with 300 years of oppression by an oligarchy known as “las familias quatorce,’ the fourteen families.  In the midst of this, Romero tried to somehow walk a fine line between maintaining relations with the government and taking his stand at the margins with the thousands of  victims of their repression.
 
The turning point for Romero came after a priest, a close friend from seminary was assassinated.  A government security force ambushed a car carrying Rutillio Grande, SJ, who had been leading a movement empowering the poorest farmers, along with two other Salvadorans.  The three of them were gunned down on their way to a small village, were Grande was to celebrate a church service.  Upon hearing of the death of his friend,  Romero was presented with a moment that he had always feared — who was he to be when there was no more room to equivocate, when there was no more time to wait, when what abided within him could no longer be ignored?  The Archbishop, brought to the precipice by his love for and grief at his friend’s murder, made the leap back into himself.  In a church procession near to where Grande had been murdered, while armed military death squads lined their path, the procession halted, fearful of what might be coming.  Unsure if they should continue or flee, the people looked to Romero for direction.  He hesitated, but said in a firm voice, “Adelante!” (Forward!)  This was who he was created to be, who he always was in his heart, and having been returned to himself he was made free.

Each of us is asked, thankfully not often for martyrdom, but simply to be ready to be returned to that which we have always held closest to our hearts.  Those truths are our path to freedom, a freedom to be the beloved creature we were born to be.   What are those truths, those long held aspirations we alone have been blessed with to contribute to our world?
